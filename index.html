            <div class="div-1">I was born into a large family and raised in a small town in Wisconsin. I had a midwestern childhood filled with hot summers and snowy winters. Because I grew up in a large family, my life is full of huge family roots. We love to celebrate and get together often.

                My passion: I love crocheting- it is quite versatile as an artistic expression. I tend to give most of my creations away as gifts. It has developed into designing crochet projects which has given me an idea for creating a new app.

                I have a love of beekeeping. My husband and I look forward to each beekeeping season and manage our four-hives down by Lake Waconia. We have a great time sharing this hobby. Every fall we harvest the honey, make wax candles, and share the spoils with family and friends.
